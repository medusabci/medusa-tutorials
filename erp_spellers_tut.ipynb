    "In this tutorial, we will work with pre-recorded data from a user participating in an ERP-based Speller experiment using the __[`RCP Speller`](https://www.medusabci.com/market/rcp_speller/)__ app from __[MEDUSA©](https://www.medusabci.com)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the experiment was to control a RCP speller composed of 36 alphanumeric commands (letters A to Z, numbers 0 to 9). These commands were encoded using classical row-column paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the calibration phase, the user focused on predefined commands for 3 runs, each consisting of 6 trials. Each trial included 15 stimulation sequences. In the online phase, the user engaged in free-spelling for 2 runs of 6 trials each (again with 15 stimulation sequences). The user was given a predefined target to assess the performance of the model later on. The EEG data were recorded from 16 active channels positioned at FZ, CZ, PZ, P3, P4, PO7, PO8, OZ, POZ, CPZ, F3, C3, PO3, F4, C4, PO4, with a sampling rate of 256 Hz.\n",
