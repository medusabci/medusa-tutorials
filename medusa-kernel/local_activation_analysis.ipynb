    "# Welcome to the local activation analysis tutorial!\n",
    "\n",
    "Medusa's local activation module implements several parameters focused on analyzing the signal of each sensor individually. That is, the parameters in this category return a single value for sensor and epoch. The parameters here can be divided in two sub-categories: spectral and non-linear. The **spectral parameters** measure different properties of the signal's power spectral density. On the other hand, the **non-linear parameters** assess the time courses of the signals, evaluating its non-linear properties such as the complexity, irregularity, or variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will cover the main functions of the module through illustrative examples that will allow you to get started in biosignal analysis with Medusa.\n",

    "    - Download an open EEG dataset and explore the files\n",
    "    - Pre-process the EEG signal with Medusa filters\n",
    "    - Know the different spectral parameters\n",
    "    - Know the different non-linear parameters\n",
    "    - Get some plots with Medusa's plot functions\n",

Then, a band-pass filter between 0.5 Hz and 30 Hz is then applied to reject the influence of the DC line noise components. We will use a finite impulse response (FIR) filter with a Hamming window."
